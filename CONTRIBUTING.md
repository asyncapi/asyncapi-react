2. Make your changes. Do not forgot about:
   - [Naming and architecture convention](./DEVELOPMENT.md#naming--architecture-convention)
   - [Project structure](./README.md/#project-structure)
   - Tests
   - Updating relevant documents if you add, remove, update props, configuration, or themes
3. Squash your changes to a single commit. Write a concise commit message in the imperative mood, as described [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

5. Create a pull request.

Pull requests are very welcome. However, if you want to add a new feature, use GitHub issues to discuss your ideas first.
