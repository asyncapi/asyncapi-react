# Contributing

## Overview

Github is used to host code, track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Contributing process

[Github flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) is used as a contributing process. This means that all changes are done by creating pull requests. Bringing a code change to this project should be executed as follows:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Make your changes. Do not forgot about:
   - [naming & architecture convention](../DEVELOPMENT.md#naming--architecture-conventions).
   - [project structure](./docs/project-structure.md).
   - tests.
   - if you added/removed/updated props/config/theme, update also relevant document for that.
3. Squash your changes to single commit. Write a concise commit message in imperative mode as described [here](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
4. Rebase your changes to latest `master`.
5. Create a pull request.

Pull requests are very welcome. However, if you want to add a new feature, please discuss your ideas first using Github issues.
